    "\n",
    "### Problem Description \n",
    "\n",
    "We were tasked with finding the root for the function $f(x) = e^{-x^3}-x^4-sin(x)$ using the bisection method with a given interval $a_0 = -1$ and $b_0 = 1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Description \n",
    "\n",
    "The bisection method is an algorithm that finds the root of a function by choosing two initial values $a_0$, $b_0$ such that the following relation holds:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(a_0)*f(b_0) < 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This relation is necessary as it tells us that a root exists between these two points. Which then allows us to then iteratively take the midpoint, c, evaluate our function and cut off the half where the root does not lie until the root is found within a desired tolerance or until a maximum number of iterations is reached. In detail this is done by evaluating f(c), if f(c) is 0 then we know that is the root and we can return c. Otherwise we must check if $f(c) * f(a) < 0$ if it is we know that the root must lie in the interval [a, c], and b = c now. Else, the root is in [c, b] and c = a now.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our program we will also be tracking the number of Floating Point Operations (FLOPS) and iterations as well. We also add an additonal check to break out as we know the actual root and want it to be within 0.5 * 10^-4. \n",
